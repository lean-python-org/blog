Summary: Python pickle is something many of us have had a love-hate relationship with. We've loved it before using it and hated it afterwards ;-) Maybe we should put pickle in the Deprecate Python category?

Python pickle is something many of us have had a love-hate relationship with. We've loved it before using it and hated it afterwards ;-). Even the official documentation at [pickle â€” Python object serialization](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) seems a bit faint in its praise.

Maybe we should put pickle in the **Deprecate Python** category?

Fair comment? Overly harsh? What do you think?

Note - the following comments were transferred over from a more general blog post about features so all the pickle content can be together.
